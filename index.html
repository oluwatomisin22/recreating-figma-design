            <h2>What makes Basecamp special?</h2>
            <p>
                
                It’s dialed in.<strong>For nearly two decades, we’ve continually refined a
                unique set of tools and methods to fundamentally reduce complexity,
                and make project management more of a joy and less of a chore.</strong> 
                Perfected and pressure-tested by hundreds of thousands of teams on
                millions of projects, Basecamp’s the gold standard for a simpler,
                superior version of project management.<br />
                As Tobi Lütke, Shopify’s CEO says, “I’ve used Basecamp for a
                million projects over the last decade and a half. <strong>It’s beautiful
                software that has resisted every wrong trend and stayed true to the
                things that mattered most.</strong> Highly recommended.”Basecamp works
                because’s <strong>the easiest place for everyone in every role </strong>to put the
                stuff, work on the stuff, discuss the stuff, decide on the stuff,
                and deliver the stuff that makes up every project. Not on separate
                platforms scattered in various places, but all intuitively organized
                in one centralized place where everyone can work together, no matter
                if work is in an office or <a href="#">remote.</a><br />
                Basecamp’s intentionally simple by design. It’s why teams that
                sometimes leave in search of “more power” end up slamming into the
                consequences of over-powered software: Complexity.<strong> Complexity
                doesn’t work. Basecamp does.</strong> It’s why those that leave end up coming
                back and sticking with us the second time around. You never know
                what you had until it’s gone.<br />
                <strong>Who uses Basecamp?</strong> Top notch marketing firms, ad
                agencies, design shops, software developers, client services firms,
                IT firms, consultants, freelancers, builders, contractors,
                publishers, schools, governments, religious organizations,
                charities, non-profits, first responders… <strong>75,000 organizations,
                big and small, across every industry imaginable, from 166 countries
                on five continents. </strong> <br />So simplify. Get it together. Ditch the
                frustrating and ineffective “stuff scattered everywhere” multi-app
                approach, and switch to Basecamp’s all-in-one, unified, and
                organized project management method instead. <strong> Level up.</strong>
