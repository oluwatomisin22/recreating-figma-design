                                                It’s dialed in. For nearly two decades, we’ve continually refined a unique 
                                                set of tools and methods to fundamentally reduce complexity, and make project 
                                                management more of a joy and less of a chore. Perfected and pressure-tested by
                                                hundreds of thousands of teams on millions of projects, Basecamp’s the gold standard
                                                for a simpler, superior version of project management<br>
                                                .As Tobi Lütke, Shopify’s CEO says, “I’ve used Basecamp for a million projects over the last decade and a half.
                                                It’s beautiful software that has resisted every wrong trend and stayed true to the things that mattered most.
                                                Highly recommended.”Basecamp works because it’s the easiest place for everyone in every role to put the stuff, 
                                                work on the stuff, discuss the stuff, decide on the stuff, and deliver the stuff that makes up every project. 
                                                Not on separate platforms scattered in various places, but all intuitively organized in one centralized place
                                                where everyone can work together, no matter if work is in an office or <a href="#">remote.</a><br>
                                                Basecamp’s intentionally simple by design. It’s why teams that sometimes leave in search of “more power” end up 
                                                slamming into the consequences of over-powered software: Complexity. Complexity doesn’t work. Basecamp does. It’s why 
                                                those that leave end up coming back and sticking with us the second time around. You never know what you had until it’s gone.<br>
                                                <strong>Who uses Basecamp?</strong> Top notch marketing firms, ad agencies, design shops, software developers, client services firms, IT firms, consultants,
                                                freelancers, builders, contractors, publishers, schools, governments, religious organizations, charities,
                                                non-profits, first responders… Over 75,000 organizations, big and small, across every industry imaginable, from 166 countries on five continents.
                                                <br>So simplify. Get it together. Ditch the frustrating and ineffective “stuff scattered everywhere” multi-app approach, and switch to Basecamp’s all-in-one, 
                                                unified, and organized project management method instead. Level up.
